A repository for my WVC course: CIST 5B: Advanced Python

## About Me
I'm a Middle College student at Leigh High School/West Valley College. I'm taking this course both for the grade and to brush up on Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm already well-versed in computer science

## Learning Goals

I hope to become versed in Jupyter Notebook and more formal Python workflows, as well as to redeem my grade from the first time I took this course.

## Hello World in Python

```python

def main():
  print("Hello World");

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

```
